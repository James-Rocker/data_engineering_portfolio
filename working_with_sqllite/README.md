# Working with SqlLite

The database object should already.
The code is a bit scrappy, I was playing around with modules as classes

## to run
install Python 3 and install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` in project root.
You can then either use `python3 working_with_sqllite/main.py` to show data being inserted into the local db then
check the number of rows inserted into the db. 

There's a truncate function so the table won't spiral out of proportion
