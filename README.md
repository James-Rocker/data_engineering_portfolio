# Data Engineering Project 

This project is meant to showcase some very basic examples of data engineering things I've built.
Actual projects are significantly more complicated, usually have infrastructure as code and contain domain specific
knowledge. 

## Working with SQLlite database

## Working with Postgres

## Working with Spark

## Working with Airflow

A simple project to show the use of python to getting data into a SqlLite database.
This includes creating database, tables, importing the data and then returning a select statement with the data

## Getting Started

Some projects will require a copy of Python 3, while others will require a copy of docker to run. I will make sure to
specify what is needed in each

To load the project, you will need to activate the venv and then run the main.py.
Or to run through the commandline, you can run the activate.bat in the project root
